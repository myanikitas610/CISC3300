1. Javascript is a programming langauage that adds dynamic interactions to web pages, applications, servers, and games. 
An interpreted programming language complies slower and is more flexible than a complied langauge. 

2. var is global and function scoped and redeclarable, let is block scoped and redeclarable as well, const is block scoped but not declarable. 

3. An anonymous function is a function without a name. A higher order function is a function that returns a function or takes other functions as arguments.

4. Objects are non primitive data types and are a collection of properties. They are different from other OOP languages because objects in Javascript can inhert properties and methods from other objects.
