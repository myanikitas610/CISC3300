But it's not difficult to imagine the amazing pursuits you'll be prepared for with a degree in computer science from Fordham's department of Computer and Information Sciences. </div>

You'll also study philosophy, theology, history, mathematics, languages, and the performing arts through Fordham's common core curriculum, the centerpiece of our liberal arts education.
