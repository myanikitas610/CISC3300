1. HTTP is a protocol for fetching resources such as HTML documents. It is how the internet handles communication between clients and servers.
The GET method recieves data, POST submits an entity to the specified resource, PUT replaces all surrent represtations of the target resouce with the request payload,
PATCH partially modifies a resource, and DELETE deletes a resource. 

2. An API is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other can be accessed with HTTP requests.
JSON is text data but Javascript is ready to parse it into javascript objects and vice versa.

3. AJAX is a technique for loading data into part of a page without having to refresh the page. 
Asynchronous code means it can run in the background without blocking the execution of other code.
